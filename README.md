# GRDC2NetCDF
Python code to convert Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) files to NetCDF

The resulting netCDF file will contain point-time series, ie. not a grid! 

This function was written as part of the eWaterCycle project (http://eWaterCycle.org).
In the eWaterCycle project, the output of this function is used to compare the fore-
casts of the eWaterCycle project to measured discharges. The comparison is done using
the Climate Data Operators (CDO) toolset (https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo).
